Positive Emotions: Amusement, Approval, Admiration, Caring, Curiosity, Desire, Excitement, Gratitude, Joy, Love, Optimism, Pride, Relief, 
Negtaive Emotions: Anger, Annoyance, Disappointment, Disapproval, Disgust, Embarrassment, Fear, Grief, Nervousness, Remorse, Sadness
Neutral: Realization, Surprise, Neutral (not included in the classification)
